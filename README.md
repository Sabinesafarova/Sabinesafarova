Language on social media platforms changes quickly in this digital age, reflecting changes in culture. Studying this change in language is important as it looks at how people incorporate popular terms from the media into their writing. This in turn, provides an insight into the dynamic relationship that exists between online communication and larger cultural trends. Gaining an understanding of this evolution not only improves our understanding of the use of modern language and its effects on society, but it's also beneficial for understanding the impact of cultural trends. The change of language on social media can be interpreted as a lot of different things. This study will focus on the frequency of words during certain periods, or societal happenings. More specifically, the topic of this research is the use of the words "climate change" on Twitter outside of American election time and during American election time. Examining the frequency of words, in this case "climate change," on Twitter over time provides a useful insight on how to view public debate, media coverage, and the impact of the elections on the sentiment and interest people have with regards to climate change.

Considering the topic of this research is very specific, no previous research has been done about the exact same thing and even the topic of language use on social media, and its relation to cultural trends has been studied little. However, there are several papers that are still relevant to the topic. Research 1 is about studying language use on social media and it discusses the difficulties in gathering and interpreting data in this ever-changing online space. This can be of importance to my own research, in terms of evaluating the retrieved data. Research 2 examines patterns in language on Facebook, highlighting the alarming emergence of nationalism in online debates. The study focusses on a different topic and different social media platform, however, its nature is similar to my own research. I believe that the way the research is conducted can provide a helpful insight to continue my own study. Furthermore, research 2 discovered that common topics including crime, violence, war, elections, and insurgency are addressed online in the midst of this social media revolution, which is a correlation that is relevant to my own research. Source 3 is the largest dataset project on people's opinions on Twitter regarding climate change, spanning more than 13 years. The data set is based on more than 15 million tweets worldwide. The citations of these studies can be found at the end of this page.

The research question is: How does the use of the use of the words "climate change" evolve over time on Twitter in terms of frequency, when looking outside of American election time and during American election time. 
Hypotheses: The words "climate change" are used more often by Twitter users during the American elections and the sentiments of these Tweets with regards to climate change vary. 

The method of this research will be to collect data on Twitter and maybe via the data base of source 3, by searching for the words climate change and then limiting the results by including a time frame (the American election period) or relevant hashtags, such as #Elections2020. This will give the opportunity to view the number of results for each search query.

It has the heftiest temporal coverage, spanning over 13 years, includes over 15 million tweets spatially distributed across the world, and provides the geolocation of most tweets. Seven dimensions of information are tied to each tweet, namely geolocation, user gender, climate change stance and sentiment, aggressiveness, deviations from historic temperature, and topic modeling, while accompanied by environmental disaster events information. These dimensions were produced by testing and evaluating a plethora of state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms and methods, both supervised and unsupervised, including BERT, RNN, LSTM, CNN, SVM, Naive Bayes, VADER, Textblob, Flair, and LDA.}
