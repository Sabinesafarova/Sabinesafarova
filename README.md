Final Report: Abstract
This study examines the dynamic lan-
guage evolution on Twitter, with a fo-
cus on the sentiment and frequency of
the words ”climate change” outside and
during US election time. The study ex-
amines language evolution using quantita-
tive methodologies, utilizing a substantial
dataset that spans over 13 years, and fur-
ther examining Tweets via restricting the
results. The predictions of the outcome of
this research show an increased use of the
words ”climate change” during the Amer-
ican elections. Analyzing the frequency of
words, like ”climate change,” on Twitter
over time offers a valuable perspective on
how the public perceives a topic of discus-
sion, the media’s coverage of it, and in this
case, how the elections have affected pub-
lic opinion and interest in climate change.
1 Introduction
Language on social media platforms changes
quickly in our digital society, reflecting
changes in our culture. Studying this change
in language is important as it looks at how
people incorporate popular terms from the
media into their writing and speech. This,
in turn, provides an insight into the dynamic
relationship that exists between online com-
munication and larger cultural trends in our
society. Gaining an understanding of this
change not only improves our understanding
of the use of modern language and its effects
on society, but it’s also beneficial for under-
standing the impact that cultural trends can
have. The evolution of language on social
media can be interpreted as a lot of different
things. This study will focus on the frequency
of words during certain periods or societal
happenings. More specifically, the topic of
this research is the use of the words ”climate
change” on Twitter outside of American elec-
tion time and during American election time.
Examining the frequency of words, in this
case, ”climate change,” on Twitter over time
provides a useful insight into how to view a
topic of public debate, its media coverage,
and, in this specific case, the impact of the
elections on the sentiment and interest peo-
ple have with regards to climate change. This
leads us to the research question: “How does
the use of the words ‘climate change’ evolve
on Twitter in terms of frequency when look-
ing outside of American election time and
during American election time?”
2 Related Work
Considering the topic of this research is very spe-
cific, no previous research has been done about the
same thing and even the topic of language use on
social media, and its relation to cultural trends has
been studied little. However, several papers are
still relevant to the topic. These papers will be
discussed here. Research 1 is about studying lan-
guage use on social media and it discusses the dif-
ficulties in assembling and interpreting data on so-
cial media platforms. This can be of importance to
this research, in terms of evaluating the retrieved
data. Research 1 is mainly focused on quantita-
tive data and the evaluation of it, where several
good programs are suggested for processing this
data. “Chapter 9 focuses on the analysis of quan-
titative data. Computer software programs includ-
ing SPSS, NVivo, and Microsoft Excel are sug-
gested.”Agwuocha (2019). This makes for good
suggestions for the processing of this research’s
data, which can, in turn, be evaluated. The pa-
per further states that ethical matters ought to be
looked over. It suggests that researchers cannot
just take people’s posts off of social media and
use it, without taking into account certain guide-
lines. For example, a participant’s identity should
not be disclosed and consent is required in case
it will be. Agwuocha (2019). Research 2 exam-
ines patterns in language on Facebook, highlight-
ing the alarming rise of nationalism in online de-
batesAkayoglu (2016). This study focuses on a
different topic than this paper and different social
media platforms, however, its nature is similar to
this research. I believe that the way the research is
conducted can provide helpful insight to continue
this study. Namely, research 2 discovered that top-
ics like crime, violence, war, elections, and insur-
gency are addressed online during this social me-
dia revolution, which is a correlation that is rele-
vant to this research. Source 3 is the largest dataset
project on people’s opinions on Twitter regarding
climate change, spanning more than 13 yearsEf-
frosynidis et al. (2022). The data set is based on
more than 15 million tweets worldwide. This data
set will be discussed further, later in this paper, as
it will be the basis data set of this research.
3 Data
Source 3, mentioned earlier in this paper, lays a
great basis for this research. It contains a data
set on the exact words that need to be examined
in this paper. Hence, the method of this research
will be to collect data via the database of source
3, and further searching for the words ’Climate
Change” on Twitter and then limiting the results
by including a time frame (the American elec-
tion period) or relevant hashtags, such as Elec-
tions2020. This will allow viewing the number
of results for each search query. These results
will also include retweets, which is positive, as
it provides more insight on the frequency on the
use of the words ”Climate Change”. Using the
database from source 3 and examining Tweets via
applying restrictions on Twitter, the sentiment of
said Tweets will then be examined, along with
their frequency. This will provide an inside into
how much people tend to use the words ”Climate
Change” outside of American election time and
during American election time.
4 Predicted Results
The expected outcome of this research is that the
words ”climate change” are used more often by
Twitter users during the American elections and
the sentiments of these Tweets with regards to cli-
mate change vary.
Discussion
5 Conclusion
In conclusion, this research aimed to explore the
evolution of language on Twitter, with a particular
focus on the use of the words “Climate Change”
and their frequency during American Election
time and outside of it. The primary source of
data for this analysis is Source 3, a large dataset
that spans more than 13 years and includes over
15 million tweets globally. Using this dataset,
the study intends to achieve the examination men-
tioned above. Anticipated results suggest an in-
creased usage of the term ”climate change” during
American elections, with a diverse range of senti-
ments expressed in the examined tweets, consid-
ering the American Elections are a time of dis-
cussing climate change. This study mainly con-
tributes to a better understanding of how language
can evolve in online debates and how it can con-
nect to social happenings

Language on social media platforms changes quickly in this digital age, reflecting changes in culture. Studying this change in language is important as it looks at how people incorporate popular terms from the media into their writing. This in turn, provides an insight into the dynamic relationship that exists between online communication and larger cultural trends. Gaining an understanding of this evolution not only improves our understanding of the use of modern language and its effects on society, but it's also beneficial for understanding the impact of cultural trends. The change of language on social media can be interpreted as a lot of different things. This study will focus on the frequency of words during certain periods, or societal happenings. More specifically, the topic of this research is the use of the words "climate change" on Twitter outside of American election time and during American election time. Examining the frequency of words, in this case "climate change," on Twitter over time provides a useful insight on how to view public debate, media coverage, and the impact of the elections on the sentiment and interest people have with regards to climate change.

Considering the topic of this research is very specific, no previous research has been done about the exact same thing and even the topic of language use on social media, and its relation to cultural trends has been studied little. However, there are several papers that are still relevant to the topic. Research 1 is about studying language use on social media and it discusses the difficulties in gathering and interpreting data in this ever-changing online space. This can be of importance to my own research, in terms of evaluating the retrieved data. Research 2 examines patterns in language on Facebook, highlighting the alarming emergence of nationalism in online debates. The study focusses on a different topic and different social media platform, however, its nature is similar to my own research. I believe that the way the research is conducted can provide a helpful insight to continue my own study. Furthermore, research 2 discovered that common topics including crime, violence, war, elections, and insurgency are addressed online in the midst of this social media revolution, which is a correlation that is relevant to my own research. Source 3 is the largest dataset project on people's opinions on Twitter regarding climate change, spanning more than 13 years. The data set is based on more than 15 million tweets worldwide. The citations of these studies can be found at the end of this page.

The research question is: How does the use of the use of the words "climate change" evolve over time on Twitter in terms of frequency, when looking outside of American election time and during American election time. 
Hypotheses: The words "climate change" are used more often by Twitter users during the American elections and the sentiments of these Tweets with regards to climate change vary. 

The method of this research will be to collect data on Twitter and maybe via the data base of source 3, by searching for the words climate change and then limiting the results by including a time frame (the American election period) or relevant hashtags, such as #Elections2020. This will give the opportunity to view the number of results for each search query.
